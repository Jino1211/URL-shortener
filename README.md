## URL shorter by YEHONATAN ROZMARIN

this is my shortner url project.
I added some bonus like those:

## bonus

- - Custom short URL. Support optional `shorturl-id` parameter in your `POST` request.
- add test for legal short that not exist
- add test for short that already in DB and expect to received an error
- Serve a styled statistics dashboard instead of the default JSON statistics.
- Use the [`JSONBIN.io`](https://jsonbin.io/) service bin as your persistent layer in your back-end DB class.
